# INSERT INTO SELECT
/*
the columns that are not filled with data, will contain NULL
The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.
The INSERT INTO SELECT statement requires that the data types in source and target tables matches.
Note: The existing records in the target table are unaffected.
Copy all columns from one table to another table:
